# ElementReplication
Experiment with flawed C++ code

In this code example we will find issues and will attempt
to describe possible alternate approaches.

The reason for this post is to show and example that I
encountered while taking and on-line course.

Yes, I was surprised with it and with the person describing
what was going on.

Next time you are planning on signing up for an on-line course
make sure that you learn as much as possible about the course
as possible.

If interest in the associated post in my blog, I invite you to
take a look at:
